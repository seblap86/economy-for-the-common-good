Data cleaning:
- Type code: Gemeinde / M1.2 correction
- Audit type: AbPE = Peer?
- Testat vs. Zertifikat?
- Check if some missing values can be replaced by hand (if there are only few)
- "//" in postal codes and cities, one "12345" in postal code without city
- SEKEM -> Egypt? Germany?

Code improvements:
- Resolve hard coding issues (balance_details)

Research questions:
- Provide summary information about balances for companies? Like first balance (interesting for when they entered ECG), last balance?
- Maybe also improvement over years? (maybe more an analytics than an engineering task)
- Or min max? (year, balance?)
- Include only valid certificate (compare date to current date)
